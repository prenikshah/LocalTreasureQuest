# Local Treasure Quest

# Inspiration
I drew inspiration from a college treasure hunt game and envisioned a new event where individuals craft their own puzzles based on the local area, inviting others to explore and solve them.

# What it does
"Local Treasure Quest" is an app that turns any area into an adventure. Solve puzzles using your phone's camera, discover hidden rewards, and engage with your community in an interactive adventure through augmented reality.

# How we built it
I developed a location-based AR game using Unity 2022.3.121, integrating AR Foundation with Google Maps API and a Geo-Spatial plugin. The game overlays AR elements on real-world locations retrieved from Google Maps, utilizing the plugin for enhanced geo-based interactions. The process involved setting up Unity, coding interactions, and testing for a seamless AR experience, resulting in a game that merges virtual gameplay with real-world environments.

# What we learned
We expanded our knowledge by delving into Google Geo Spatials and explored creating anchors. Additionally, we've been learning about the Cesium library and ARCore extensions, broadening our understanding of spatial technologies and augmented reality.

# What's next for Local Treasure Quest
We're adding user-generated events with runtime anchors, allowing players to create and share their own in-game events with friends. Additionally, we're implementing an in-app navigation feature for easy location guidance, making it simpler to navigate to specific game locations.
